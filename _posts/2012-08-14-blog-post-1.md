I work on scRNAseq data and I use SCENIC, a gold-standard package for scRNAseq data analysis.

Abstract
======
We present SCENIC, a computational method for simultaneous gene regulatory network reconstruction and cell-state identification from single-cell RNA-seq data (http://scenic.aertslab.org). On a compendium of single-cell data from tumors and brain, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory analysis can be exploited to guide the identification of transcription factors and cell states. SCENIC provides critical biological insights into the mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity.
