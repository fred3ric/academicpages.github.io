Interesting study where WES is used on metatastic ccRCC patients. Authors found LOF mutations in PBRM1 gene on CB samples. Patients whose tumors showed biallelic PBRM1 loss had significantly prolonged OS and PFS compared to patients without PBRM1 LOF.

Abstract
======
Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) improve survival in a subset of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To identify genomic alterations in ccRCC that correlate with response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, we performed whole exome sequencing of metastatic ccRCC from 35 patients. They found that clinical benefit was associated with loss-of-function mutations in the PBRM1 gene (p=0.012), which encodes a subunit of a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (the PBAF subtype).They confirmed this finding in an independent validation cohort of 63 ccRCC patients treated with PD-(L)1 blockade therapy alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 therapies (p=0.0071). Gene expression analysis of PBAF-deficient ccRCC cell lines and PBRM1-deficient tumors revealed altered transcriptional output in JAK/STAT, hypoxia, and immune signaling pathways. PBRM1 loss in ccRCC may alter global tumor cell expression profiles to influence responsiveness to immune checkpoint therapy.
