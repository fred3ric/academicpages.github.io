This work shows that cationic lipid-mediated Cas9–sgRNA complex delivery in vivo can achieve allele-specific gene disruption in a mouse model of a human genetic disease, resulting in amelioration of the disease phenotype.

Abstract
======
Although genetic factors contribute to almost half of all cases of deafness, treatment options for genetic deafness are limited. We developed a genome-editing approach to target a dominantly inherited form of genetic deafness. Here we show that cationic lipid-mediated in vivo delivery of Cas9–guide RNA complexes can
ameliorate hearing loss in a <code><sup>mouse</sup></code> model of human genetic deafness. We designed and validated, both in vitro and in primary fibroblasts, genome editing agents that preferentially disrupt the dominant deafness-associated allele in the *Tmc1* (transmembrane channellike gene family 1) Beethoven (*Bth*) mouse model, even though the mutant <code>*Tmc1^bth^*</code>allele differs from the wild-type allele at only a single base pair. Injection of Cas9–guide RNA–lipid complexes targeting the *Tmc1^Bth^* allele into the cochlea of neonatal *Tmc1^Bth/+^* mice substantially reduced progressive hearing loss. We observed
higher hair cell survival rates and lower auditory brainstem response thresholds in injected ears than in uninjected ears or ears injected with control complexes that targeted an unrelated gene. Enhanced
acoustic startle responses were observed among injected compared to uninjected *Tmc1^Bth/+^* mice. These findings suggest that protein–RNA complex delivery of target gene-disrupting agents in vivo is
a potential strategy for the treatment of some types of autosomal dominant hearing loss.
